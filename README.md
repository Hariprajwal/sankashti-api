# 🌙 Sankashti & Purnima API

A public API that calculates **Sankashti Chaturthi** and **Purnima (Full Moon)** dates using astronomical calculations based on the **Hindu lunar calendar (Panchang)**.

This project uses **Sun–Moon angular mathematics (Tithi calculation)** to determine lunar events instead of hardcoding calendar dates.

The API provides endpoints to:

- Check if **today is Sankashti**
- Find the **next Sankashti**
- Get the **full Sankashti calendar for a year**
- Check if **today is Purnima**
- Find the **next Purnima**
- Generate the **full Purnima calendar for a year**

# 🧠 How the Calculation Works

In the Hindu calendar, time is divided into **30 lunar days called Tithis**.

Each Tithi corresponds to **12° difference between Moon and Sun**.

```
Angle = (Moon Longitude − Sun Longitude) % 360
# Sankashti Chaturthi API

A high-performance API providing accurate dates and timings for Sankashti Chaturthi.

## 🚀 Features
- Accurate fasting dates for the current year.
- Easy-to-use JSON format.
- Lightweight and fast response times.

## 🛠 Usage
Provide a simple example request:
```bash
curl [https://your-api-url.com/api/sankashti](https://your-api-url.com/api/sankashti)
```

```
Tithi = int(angle / 12) + 1
```

---

## 🌙 Sankashti Chaturthi

Sankashti occurs when:

```
Tithi = 19
```

Which corresponds to:

```
Krishna Paksha Chaturthi
```

Unlike most festivals, Sankashti is determined by **Moonrise**.

Rule:

> If Chaturthi tithi is present at **moonrise**, that day is Sankashti.

---

## 🌕 Purnima

Purnima occurs when:

```
Tithi = 15
```

Which corresponds to the **Full Moon**.

Rule:

> If Purnima tithi is present at **sunrise**, that day is Purnima.
